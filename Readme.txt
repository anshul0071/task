Contents:
1. A script.js file
2. A db.json to store the flight name and prices.


Instructions:
1. Just extract the contents of Server file. It may take a while as I have also compressed the nodeModules folder to avoid any installation of pacakges.
2. Just  npm start to start the server and  node script to run the script.js file and you are good to go.
